# complex_word_classifier

Predicting which words are considered hard to understand for a given target population is a vital step in many Natural Language Processing applications such as text simplification. A system could simplify texts for second language learners, native speakers with low literacy levels, and people with reading disabilities. This task is commonly referred to as Complex Word Identification. Usually, this task is approached as a binary classification task in which systems predict a complexity value (complex vs. non-complex) for a set of target words in a text. In this challenge, the task is to predict the lexical complexity of a word in a sentence. A word which is considered to be complex has label 1, a word is considered to be simple (non-complex) has label 0.
